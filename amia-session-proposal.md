# A Grand Unified Theory: PBCore, EBUCore, and the Semantic Web

Session Title: A Grand Unified Theory: PBCore, EBUCore, and the Semantic Web

Session Type: Panel Discussion

Length of Session Requested: 60 minutes

## Abstract for printed program (150 words maximum): 

The adoption of PBCore in the United States has paralleled the rise of EBUCore in Europe as core metadata standards for audiovisual materials. During the past year, the two communities have formed a working group to explore ways to align PBCore and EBUCore for interoperability. Coinciding with the release of the PBCore 2.1 Schema in May 2015, it was decided to stop reinventing existing vocabularies, and instead leverage excellent work already completed by the European community. This paves the way for the adoption by PBCore of the EBUCore ontology, and unifying the vocabularies of both metadata standards. This means PBCore users can now also take advantage of EBUCore’s integration with RDF and semantic web applications. During this session, working group leaders from EBUCore and PBCore will tell the story of this work, and how it can be leveraged by users of both communities.

## Description and information for peer review (300 words maximum):

The adoption of PBCore in the United States has paralleled the rise of EBUCore in Europe as core metadata standards for audiovisual materials. PBCore and EBUCore were developed by different communities for somewhat different reasons. PBCore was  designed for public broadcasting in the United States as  data model and XML format for metadata exchange. EBUCore provides a framework for descriptive and technical metadata for semantic web and linked data applications. As PBCore has become adopted by audiovisual archivists in film archives and academic institutions, interested has grown in making PBCore compatible with RDF and the semantic web. During the past year while developing the PBCore version 2.1 schema, it became clear that PBCore lacked an RDF compatible ontology for its metadata elements, relationships, and controlled vocabularies. The question arose: Should we create a new ontology for PBCore, or consider adopting the RDF ontology already created for EBUCore? 

The PBCore and EBUCore communities formed a working group to answer this question. Coinciding with the release of the PBCore 2.1 Schema in May 2015, it was decided to leverage the excellent work already completed by the European community. This paves the way for the adoption by PBCore of the EBUCore ontology, and unifying the vocabularies of both metadata standards. PBCore users can continue leveraging the simplicity of PBCore, as nothing about PBCore 2.1 breaks compatibility with existing applications. If they wish, PBCore users can now also take advantage of EBUCore’s integration with RDF and semantic web applications. This opens new opportunities for closer collaboration with the Europeana community among others, and new linked data applications for archival collections using PBCore metadata. During this session, working group leaders from EBUCore and PBCore will tell the story of this work, what it means, and how it can be leveraged by users of both communities.

Yes (in Access and Use curated stream)
I can talk about the PBCore progress to date, background on the
PBCore/EBUCore RDF ontology work, and how we came to the decision to
establish international interoperability instead of reinventing the wheel.
I will discuss the two hackathons and how we went about conducting the
mapping.

Subject: I will illustrate how to use PBCore in the descriptive and technical metadata sections of METS documents. This is meant to demonstrate the flexibility of the PBCore standard and structure, especially when used with other standards such as METS and EBUCore.
